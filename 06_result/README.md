- What is a polygenic risk score?

**Nature Reviews**
- How are sequencing and microarray technologies similar? How do they differ?
- What is next generation sequencing? (NGS)? 
- Generate a diagram/cartoon and label it with text to explain how one NGS technology explained in the reading works.
- What is whole genome sequencing? How does that differ from exome sequencing?
