## Data

There are many genetic datasets available from across the world. 

- The project will primarily use [1000 Genomes Project](https://www.internationalgenome.org/) data
- We will be replicating a result from [Genes Mirror Geography within Europe](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2735096/)
